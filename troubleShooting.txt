Following this tutorial: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/

When following the tutorial 'amplify init ...' was not working. I did 'amplify pull ...' as instructed 
by the Amplify Console.

I got a build error saying that had JSONValidationError.
To fix this I went to AmplifyConsole > BuildSettings > BuildImageSettings > Edit and made sure the AmplifyCLI version is 
the same that I'm using locally. 

I then got a build error when cloning the repo. 
I went to the github repo > settings > webhooks and deleted the amplify webhook.
I then returned to Amplify Console and clicked Reconnect Repository.
This didn't fix the issue, I also needed to create a service role that gives Amplify permission to update the backend:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/how-to-service-role-amplify-console.html
Gave the service role Permissions Policies: AdministratorAccess and AdministratorAccess-Amplify
