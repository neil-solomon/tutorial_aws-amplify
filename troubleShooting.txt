Following this tutorial: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/

When following the tutorial 'amplify init ...' was not working. I did 'amplify pull ...' as instructed 
by the Amplify Console.

I got a build error saying that had JSONValidationError.
To fix this I went to AmplifyConsole > BuildSettings > BuildImageSettings > Edit and made sure the AmplifyCLI version is 
the same that I'm using locally. 

I then got a build error when cloning the repo. 
I went to the github repo > settings > webhooks and deleted the amplify webhook.
I went to the github repo > settings > deploy keys and deleted all of the keys.
I then returned to Amplify Console and clicked Reconnect Repository.
This didn't fix the issue, I also needed to create a service role that gives Amplify permission to update the backend:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/how-to-service-role-amplify-console.html
Gave the service role Permissions Policies: AdministratorAccess and AdministratorAccess-Amplify

The grapql api key expires after a week. To refresh it:
1. in amplify/backend/tutorialAwsAmplify/parameters.json set CreateAPIKey: 0  
2. amplify push and say yes to defaults
3. in amplify/backend/tutorialAwsAmplify/parameters.json set CreateAPIKey: 1  
4. amplify push and say yes to defaults
Steps 1 and 2 delete the old key, steps 3 and 4 create the new key.
Keys can be managed in the AWS AppSync Console under settings.

in progress:
    Added @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) to amplify/backend/tutorialAwsAmplify/schema.graphql
    This should only allow users who created a post to be able to list, update, and delete that post.
    In order to make this work I tried to 'amplify update api' and choose to use Cognito User Pool for api security, and 
    choose API key as an additional authorization type. Also tried using API key as primary and Cognito as secondary, neither work.
    Trying all of this messed up the deployed site, it now only works on localhost. Google login doesnt work.
