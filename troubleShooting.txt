Following this tutorial: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/

When following the tutorial 'amplify init ...' was not working. I did 'amplify pull ...' as instructed 
by the Amplify Console.

I got a build error saying that had JSONValidationError.
To fix this I went to AmplifyConsole > BuildSettings > BuildImageSettings > Edit and made sure the AmplifyCLI version is 
the same that I'm using locally. 

I then got a build error when cloning the repo. 
I went to the github repo > settings > webhooks and deleted the amplify webhook.
I went to the github repo > settings > deploy keys and deleted all of the keys.
I then returned to Amplify Console and clicked Reconnect Repository.
This didn't fix the issue, I also needed to create a service role that gives Amplify permission to update the backend:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/how-to-service-role-amplify-console.html
Gave the service role Permissions Policies: AdministratorAccess and AdministratorAccess-Amplify

The grapql api key expires after a week. To refresh it:
1. in amplify/backend/tutorialAwsAmplify/parameters.json set CreateAPIKey: 0  
2. amplify push and say yes to defaults
3. in amplify/backend/tutorialAwsAmplify/parameters.json set CreateAPIKey: 1  
4. amplify push and say yes to defaults
Steps 1 and 2 delete the old key, steps 3 and 4 create the new key.
Keys can be managed in the AWS AppSync Console under settings.

To make auth changes to a graphql thing
    Add/remove @auth from the entry
    'amplify api gql-compile' updates files (including the frontend)
    'amplify push' then push a commit to github for the frontend changes.

Removing @auth and doing the above steps made everything work, even when Cognito was set as a secondary API authorization
Tried using @aws_cognito_user_pools instead of @auth. didn't work

It looks like the owner of a table entry is being correctly determined by user.
The problem is that the current user is stored across the browser, so on page refresh I get logged in as the latest
log in in the browser, even if it was from a different window. 

The owner in dynamodb is the same as the username in coginto user pool, but this username is auto-generated random stuff.

To make the subscription work make a graphql query the same way fetchNotes() does and pass in the username in the owner variable.

Can't get the cypress tests working because withAuthenticator is all shadowDom stuff.
